# Brain-Control
A game controlled by brain EEG signals.

Using your brain signals, collected by an EEG device with electrodes, you can control this simple game. 

First you need to train the application, using OpenVibe software, for about 15-20 minutes so it can calibrate. Because every person is different, training must be done for every person individually. 

This requires an EEG device, such as mobi smarting, or muse. Tested with both.

Disclaimer: This is just the game, training and connecting has to be done separately. This version, without anything else can be controlled with A and D keys.

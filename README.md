# Brain-Control
A game controlled by brain EEG signals

In a nutshell, you can steer left or right using your brain. Just imagine moving your left or right arm and the ball will move that way. This requires an EEG device, such as mobi samarting, or muse.
Tested with both.
Also openvibe is required for those who do not know how to connect.
